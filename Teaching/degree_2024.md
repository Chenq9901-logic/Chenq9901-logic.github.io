### Project Description

Kripke-completeness of modal logics has been extensively studied since 1960s. Fine raised a question concerning the degree of Kripke-incompleteness of logics in the lattice of all normal modal logics. In this project, we mainly focus on degree of incompleteness of modal logic and the proof of Blok's dichotomy theorem: every modal logic is of the degree of Kripke-incompleteness 1 or continuum.
