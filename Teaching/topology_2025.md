Coordinated project, January 2025, ILLC.

## Project Description

Topology is one of the basic areas of contemporary mathematics, and finds applications in all areas of logic: from traditionally mathematical subjects (model theory, set theory, category theory and algebraic logic) to areas of philosophy (epistemic logic, formal epistemology), formal semantics or computation (domain theory, learning theory). Its key idea is that one can understand space through very simple units -- so'called "open" and "closed" sets, and their interaction -- in a way that can capture both the intuitive properties of physical space, and also more abstract notions of ``space": spaces of ideas, information spaces, or even spaces of actions, for example, in computation.

In this project we will familiarize students with the basic concepts of topology as they are used in logical practice. This will consist in a series of introductory lecture recordings covering the basic core concepts one tends to encounter in these settings (continuity, neighbourhood filters, compactness, connectedness, separation); Q&A sessions, guiding students through practical applications of the concepts, as well as guiding them in finding an appropriate presentation topic; as well as forays into more advanced topics, pursued by the students. Importantly, we will emphasize how topology appears naturally in many logical contexts.

## Organization

Students are encouraged to follow the recording, read the lecture notes and finish the corresponding assignments every week. There will be a Q&A session every week. The (tentative) schedule is as follows:

- Week 1: A short online kick-off meeting + 3 lecture recordings + Q&A
- Week 2: 3 lecture recordings + Q&A 
- Week 3: Group consultations + Q&A 
- Week 4: Group presentations.
