Hi! I’m a PhD candidate in logic at Tsinghua University – University of Amsterdam Joint Research Centre for Logic ([JRC for Logic](http://tsinghualogic.net/JRC/)) and the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation ([ILLC](https://www.illc.uva.nl)) at the University of Amsterdam, under the supervision of [Fenrong Liu](http://fenrong.net) and [Nick Bezhanishvili](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/n.bezhanishvili/). I’m involved in a Tsinghua-UvA joint doctorate program (3 years at Tsinghua and 2 years at UvA).


## Research Interests

I am most interested in modal logic, especially interactions of operators of polymodal logic. Recently, I am focusing on the similarity and difference between basic modal logic and tense logic. I also hold an active interest in dependence logic, logic of games and other related fields.
